# GCD Calculator in Java

A Java console application that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers entered by the user. The program asks for two integers and uses a simple method to find their GCD. This project could be helpful for those new to Java, aiming to learn basic mathematical computations and simple loop structures.

## Project Description

This application is a practical tool for calculating the GCD of two numbers. It employs a straightforward approach using loops and conditional checks, making it an excellent example for beginners to understand the implementation of loops and conditions in Java. The method checks each integer from 1 up to the smaller of the two given numbers to find the largest number that divides both without leaving a remainder.

## Features

- User input for two integers.
- Calculation of GCD using iterative method.
- Display of the calculated GCD.

## How to Run

To run this application, make sure you have Java installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Download the `JavaApplication39.java` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is stored.
4. Compile the Java file using the command: `javac JavaApplication39.java`.
5. Run the compiled Java program with: `java JavaApplication39`.
6. Enter the two numbers as prompted.
